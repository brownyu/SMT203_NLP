        "One of the primary applications of natural language processing is to automatically extract what topics people are discussing from large volumes of text. Some examples of large text could be feeds from social media, customer reviews of hotels, movies, etc, user feedbacks, news stories, e-mails of customer complaints etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Knowing what people are talking about and understanding their problems and opinions is highly valuable to businesses, administrators, political campaigns. And it’s really hard to manually read through such large volumes and compile the topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus is required an automated algorithm that can read through the text documents and automatically output the topics discussed. This is called topic modeling. The ultimate goal of topic modeling is to find various topics that are present in your corpus. Each document in the corpus will be made up of at least one topic, if not multiple topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will take a real example of the COVID-19 Twitter dataset and use **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, which is one of many topic modeling techniques. It was specifically designed for text data, to extract the naturally discussed topics.\n",
        "\n",

There are two major types C_V typically 0 < x < 1 and uMass -14 < x < 14. When using c_v, the coference score of >0.5 would be considered to be good and it would be rare to see a > 0.9.
